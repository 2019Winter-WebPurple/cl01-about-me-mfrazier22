        <!--This paragraph describes Meredith Frazier's orgins and family life.-->
        <p>My name is <b>Meredith Frazier</b>. I was born on January 26, 2004. I am a freshman at Padua Academy in Wilmington, Delaware. My father's name is Josh and he is a high school math teacher. My mother's name is Shannon and she is a lawyer. I have one sister, Audrey, and she is 12 years old. </p>
        
        <!--This paragraph describes the interests of Meredith Frazier-->
        <p>I like to swim and play golf. I am currently on the Padua swim team and I have been swimming competitivley since I was five. In my free time, I enjoy listening to a variety of music, but I don't like rap music. My favorite color is either a blush pink or a pastel blue. My favorite book is <i>Catching Fire</i>. My favorite tv show is <i>The Good Place</i> or <i>The Crown</i>.</p>
        
        <p>My favorite quote from <i>The Good Place</i> is:</p>
        
        <blockquote>Principles aren’t principles when you pick and choose when you’re gonna follow them.</blockquote>
        
        <!--This paragraph describes Meredith Frazier's pets.-->
        <p>I have two dogs. The older one is 9 years old and named Wendy Darling, after the girl in <i>Peter Pan</i>. She is a short-haired, chocolate and tan minature dachshund. She likes to sleep and she loves to meet people. The younger one is 2 years old and named Jim Dear, after the husband in <i>Lady and the Tramp</i>. He is a short-haired, reverse isabella and tan dapple minature dachshund with a wall-eye. He is very sweet to his family but over protective and likes to bark. I also have a cat named April Mae, after Daisy Duck's nieces. She is a 3 year old grey and white American shorthair. </p>
